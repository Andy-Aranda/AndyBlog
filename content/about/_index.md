This is my about page. :wave:

My name's Andrea. I'm 22 years old and I'm Mexican. I'm in my last year in University, I'm studying Computer Engineering at Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana in Mexico City. :smile: 

Since I've memory, I was intersted in technollogy and how it works. Now that I know it better, I love to learn continually, specially about Data Science: I want to be a great data scientist!  :computer:
Also, I want to add that I love studying engineering because it allows me to inspire other women to be what they want, and tell them that nothing is imposible. :woman: :purple_heart:

By the other hand:
I love to read! I love contemporany latin literature and my favourite book is Travesuras de la Niña Mala by  Mario Vargas Llosa. I love doggos :dog:, travel in car with my family :car: and watch series and movies with them :popcorn:. My favourite music is indie folk and I love to hear that on cloudy days. :cloud:
